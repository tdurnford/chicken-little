1. Find the highest-priority feature to work on and work only on that feature.
This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority - not necessarily the first in the list. \
2. Use the Roblox Studio MCP server to test your changes in-game:
   - Use 'run_code' to execute Luau code directly in Roblox Studio
   - Use 'insert_model' to add models from the marketplace if needed
   - Verify your changes work correctly before committing
3. Check that the types check via and that the tests pass.
4. Update the PRD with the work that was done. \
5. Append your progress to the progress.txt file. \
Use this to leave a note for the next person working in the codebase. \
6. Make a git commit of that feature and push to the remote repository. \
ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE.
If, while implementing the feature, you notice the PRD is complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
