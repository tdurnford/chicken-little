## 2026-01-16 - Fix Predator Targeting Inconsistency (ID #6)

### Summary
Fixed a bug where predators would visually target one chicken but actually capture a different chicken during attacks.

### Problem
The `PredatorAttack.executeAttack` function was using `selectChickensForAttack` which randomly selected chickens to capture, completely ignoring the `targetChickenId` that was set by the predator AI for visual targeting. This caused a disconnect between what the player saw (predator approaching chicken A) and what actually happened (chicken B gets captured).

### Solution
Modified `selectChickensForAttack` in `src/shared/PredatorAttack.lua` to:
1. Accept an optional `targetChickenId` parameter
2. Prioritize the targeted chicken when selecting chickens for attack (if it exists and is not protected)
3. Fill remaining attack slots with random chickens as before

Also updated `executeAttack` to pass the predator's `targetChickenId` from the spawn state to the selection function.

### Files Changed
- `src/shared/PredatorAttack.lua` - Modified `selectChickensForAttack` and `executeAttack` functions
- `src/shared/IntegrationTests.lua` - Added import for PredatorAttack, added test for targeted chicken priority

### Testing
- Added integration test `"PredatorAttack: executeAttack prioritizes targeted chicken"`
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- The predator targeting now correctly prioritizes the chicken it's visually approaching
- If the targeted chicken is protected (newly placed within 15 seconds), a random chicken will be selected instead
- The `PredatorSpawning.updateTargetChicken` function is used by the server to set which chicken a predator is targeting

## 2026-01-16 - Implement Player Leveling System (ID #2)

### Summary
Added a complete player leveling system with XP requirements, level-based difficulty scaling for predators, and HUD display for level/XP progress.

### Features Implemented
1. **LevelConfig Module** (`src/shared/LevelConfig.lua`)
   - XP requirements per level (base 100 XP, scaling 15% per level)
   - Max level: 100
   - Functions: `getLevelFromXP`, `getXPForLevel`, `getLevelProgress`, `getXPToNextLevel`
   - Max predators scale with level (1 at level 1, up to 8 at high levels)
   - Threat level unlocks: Minor(1), Moderate(5), Dangerous(15), Severe(30), Deadly(50), Catastrophic(75)

2. **PlayerData Updates** (`src/shared/PlayerData.lua`)
   - Added `level` and `xp` fields to `PlayerDataSchema`
   - New functions: `getLevel`, `getXP`, `addXP`, `setLevelAndXP`
   - `addXP` returns new level when player levels up

3. **PredatorSpawning Updates** (`src/shared/PredatorSpawning.lua`)
   - `SpawnState` now includes `playerLevel`
   - `createSpawnState(playerLevel)` accepts player level
   - `getMaxActivePredators` now uses `LevelConfig.getMaxPredatorsForLevel`
   - `selectPredatorForWave` respects threat level unlocks based on player level
   - `setPlayerLevel` function for updating level on spawn state

4. **MainHUD Level Display** (`src/client/MainHUD.lua`)
   - Level badge in top-left corner showing "Level X"
   - XP progress bar below level text
   - `setLevelAndXP(level, xp, progress)` function
   - `showLevelUp(newLevel, unlocks)` celebration notification
   - `showXPGain(amount)` floating XP text

5. **Remote Events** (`src/server/RemoteSetup.lua`)
   - Added `XPGained` and `LevelUp` events

### Files Changed
- `src/shared/LevelConfig.lua` - NEW: Level configuration and XP calculations
- `src/shared/PlayerData.lua` - Added level/xp fields and helper functions
- `src/shared/PredatorSpawning.lua` - Level-based predator scaling

### Testing
- Added integration tests for LevelConfig functions
- Added tests for PlayerData XP/level functions
- Added tests for PredatorSpawning level integration
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- XP reward system (ID #7) should use `PlayerData.addXP()` to award XP for actions
- When `addXP` returns a number (new level), fire the `LevelUp` remote to show celebration
- Call `PredatorSpawning.setPlayerLevel(state, level)` when player levels up to update spawning
- The client should call `MainHUD.setLevelAndXP()` when receiving `PlayerDataChanged`
- Threat level unlocks mean players won't face Bears until level 75

---

## 2026-01-16 - Implement XP Reward System (ID #7)

### Summary
Added a complete XP reward system that awards XP for various player actions, making the leveling system (ID #2) meaningful.

4. **Client Integration** (`src/client/Main.client.lua`)
   - Added `XPGained` event handler to show XP gain notifications
   - Added `LevelUp` event handler to show level-up celebrations

5. **Sound Effects** (`src/client/SoundEffects.lua`)
   - Added `xpGain` and `levelUp` sound configurations

### XP Reward Values
| Action | Base XP | Multiplier |
|--------|---------|------------|

- `src/server/Main.server.lua` - XP reward integration for all actions
- `src/client/Main.client.lua` - XPGained and LevelUp event handlers
- `src/client/SoundEffects.lua` - Added xpGain and levelUp sounds
- `src/shared/IntegrationTests.lua` - Added 8 tests for XPConfig

### Testing
- Added 8 integration tests for XPConfig functions
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- The XP system now makes the leveling system (ID #2) meaningful
- Players receive XP notifications via `MainHUD.showXPGain(amount)`
- Level-up celebrations show via `MainHUD.showLevelUp(newLevel, unlocks)`
- Night cycle XP is awarded to all online players when night ends (dawn transition)
- Trap catch XP would need integration in `SellPredator` when trap predator selling is implemented


---

## 2026-01-16 - Implement In-Area Chicken Selling (ID #5)

### Summary
Enabled the in-area chicken selling feature that allows players to sell chickens directly by walking up to them and pressing F, with a confirmation dialog showing the sell price.

### Features Enabled
1. **Proximity Sell Prompts**
   - "[E] Pick Up" prompt shows on the left side of screen when near a chicken
   - "[F] Sell (price)" prompt shows on the right side when near a chicken
   - Prompts are positioned side-by-side to avoid overlap

2. **Server-Side Sale Integration**
   - Added `ChickenSelling.setPerformServerSale()` callback for server communication
   - Wired up to invoke `SellChicken` RemoteFunction on the server
   - Plays money collect sound on successful sale
   - Plays error sound on failed sale

3. **Mobile Touch Support**
   - Added `MobileTouchControls` import and initialization
   - Wired up all button actions: pickup, place, cancel, sell, confirm
   - Shows chicken context (pickup + sell) when near a chicken
   - Shows place context (place + cancel) when holding a chicken
   - Shows sell confirmation context when confirming a sale

4. **Store Module Enhancement**
   - Added `sellPrice` field to `Store.sellChicken()` return value
   - Returns total value including accumulated money for proper UI feedback

### Files Changed
- `src/client/ChickenSelling.lua` - Fixed prompt position, added `setPerformServerSale` callback, refactored `confirmSell` to use server callback
- `src/client/ChickenPickup.lua` - Fixed prompt position to offset left
- `src/client/Main.client.lua` - Added MobileTouchControls import, wired up server sale callback, enabled sell prompts, initialized mobile touch controls
- `src/shared/Store.lua` - Added `sellPrice` to sell transaction return value

### Testing
- Build check passes with `rojo build`
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- The ChickenSelling module now properly communicates with the server via the `SellChicken` RemoteFunction
- When a chicken is sold, the server fires `ChickenSold` event and syncs player data automatically
- Mobile players see contextual touch buttons on the right side of the screen
- The "[E] Pick Up" and "[F] Sell" prompts appear side-by-side when near a chicken
- Sell confirmation dialog shows chicken name, rarity, and total value (base + accumulated money)

---

## 2026-01-16 - Lower Money Counter Position (ID #1)

### Summary
Lowered the money counter position in the bottom-left HUD by reducing excess frame height.

### Problem
The money counter frame was 70 pixels tall but only contained a 36-pixel money label (the money icon and money-per-second label were previously removed for a cleaner UI). This left 34 pixels of unused vertical space, making the counter appear higher than necessary on screen.

### Solution
Reduced the `DEFAULT_CONFIG.size` height from 70 to 44 pixels in `src/client/MainHUD.lua`. The new height properly fits the money label with minimal padding (36px label + 4px top padding + 4px space at bottom).

### Files Changed
- `src/client/MainHUD.lua` - Reduced money frame height from 70 to 44 pixels

### Testing
- Build passes with `rojo build`
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- The money counter is now positioned 26 pixels lower on screen
- The frame uses `anchorPoint = Vector2.new(0, 1)` for bottom-left anchoring
- The position offset of -10 from the bottom edge is preserved

---

## 2026-01-16 - Fix Store Disabled Button Flash (ID #3)

### Summary
Fixed the white flash effect that occurred when clicking disabled buy buttons in the store.

### Problem
Roblox's default `AutoButtonColor` property causes TextButtons to automatically change color when pressed. This was causing a distracting white flash when players clicked on disabled (greyed out) buttons that they couldn't afford or that were sold out.

### Solution
Set `AutoButtonColor = false` on all buy buttons in the store UI:
- Egg cash buy button (line 361)
- Egg Robux buy button (line 440)
- Power-up Robux buy button (line 713)
- Trap/supply cash buy button (line 947)
- Trap/supply Robux buy button (line 1026)
- Weapon cash buy button (line 1285)
- Weapon Robux buy button (line 1357)

This prevents the default Roblox button color change behavior while preserving the custom hover effects already implemented via MouseEnter/MouseLeave handlers.

### Files Changed
- `src/client/StoreUI.lua` - Added `AutoButtonColor = false` to all 7 buy buttons

### Testing
- Format check passes with `stylua`
- Build passes with `rojo build`

### Notes for Next Developer
- The hover effects for enabled buttons still work correctly (they use custom MouseEnter/MouseLeave handlers)
- Disabled buttons now maintain their grey appearance without any visual feedback when clicked
- The tab buttons already had `AutoButtonColor = false` set (line 1894)


---

## 2026-01-16 - Restyle Store Restock Counter (ID #4)

### Summary
Restyled the restock counter in the store UI to be more subtle and clean. Removed the background, changed text to dark color, aligned to the right side, and reduced the text size.

### Problem
The restock counter spanned the entire top of the store with a large slate-blue background gradient, making it visually prominent and distracting from the store items. The counter was 35 pixels tall with bold white text and a centered alignment.

### Solution
Restyled the restock counter to be minimal and unobtrusive:
1. **Removed background**: Set `BackgroundTransparency = 1` and removed the UICorner and UIGradient decorations
2. **Dark text color**: Changed from white (`255, 255, 255`) to dark slate (`30, 41, 59`)
3. **Right-aligned**: Changed `TextXAlignment` from Center to Right, and positioned frame on the right side using `AnchorPoint = Vector2.new(1, 0)`
4. **Reduced size**: Changed from 35px tall spanning full width to 20px tall and 50% width, with `TextSize = 14` instead of scaled text (16-24px)
5. **Lighter font weight**: Changed from `GothamBold` to `Gotham` for a more subtle appearance
6. **Removed text stroke**: Set `TextStrokeTransparency = 1` since dark text on light background doesn't need it

### Files Changed
- `src/client/StoreUI.lua` - Restyled RestockFrame and RestockTimerLabel (lines 1830-1853)

### Testing
- Format check passes with `stylua`
- Build passes with `rojo build`

### Notes for Next Developer
- The counter now sits in the top-right area of the store, not spanning the full width
- The text "Restocks in X:XX" is now subtle dark text without any background
- The timer update logic (`updateRestockTimer`) remains unchanged and works correctly
- Only 1 remaining incomplete item in the PRD: #8 (Reduce Chicken Counter Icon Spacing)

---

## 2026-01-16 - Reduce Chicken Counter Icon Spacing (ID #8)

### Summary
Reduced the spacing between the chicken icon and counter number in the bottom-right HUD.

### Problem
The chicken counter had too much space between the chicken emoji icon and the count text. The icon was 32px wide and the label was positioned at x=30, creating unnecessary visual separation between the elements.

### Solution
Reduced the spacing by:
1. Icon width: 32px → 24px (better fits the 24px text size)
2. Label position offset: 30px → 26px
3. Label size adjustment: -30px → -26px for width calculation

This brings the counter number closer to the chicken icon, making them appear as a cohesive group.

### Files Changed
- `src/client/MainHUD.lua` - Reduced icon width and label position offset in `createChickenCountFrame`

### Testing
- Format check passes with `stylua`
- Build passes with `rojo build`

### Notes for Next Developer
- All 8 work items in the gameplay-improvements-prd.json are now complete
- The PRD has been fully implemented

## 2026-01-19 - Install ProfileService and Create ProfileManager (ID #1)

### Summary
Installed ProfileService via Wally and created the ProfileManager wrapper module with session locking and graceful shutdown handling.

### Features Implemented
1. **ProfileService Installation**
   - Added `brittonfischer/profileservice@2.1.5` to wally.toml
   - Package installed to Packages directory

2. **ProfileManager Module** (`src/server/ProfileManager.lua`)
   - ProfileService wrapper with session locking
   - `loadProfile(player)` - Loads profile with session locking, calculates offline earnings
   - `releaseProfile(player)` - Releases profile on player leave (auto-saves)
   - `getData(userId)` / `updateData(userId, data)` - Cached data access
   - `hasProfile(userId)` - Check if profile is loaded
   - `getLoadedProfileCount()` - Count of active profiles
   - `getGlobalChickenCounts()` - Aggregate chicken stats
   - `setupPlayerConnections()` - Auto-connects to PlayerAdded/PlayerRemoving
   - `setupShutdown()` - Graceful shutdown with game:BindToClose()
   - `start()` - Initializes and starts the profile system

3. **Session Locking**
   - Prevents data duplication across servers
   - Kicks player if profile is released (e.g., joined from another server)
   - Handles player leaving during load

4. **Offline Earnings**
   - Calculates and applies offline earnings on profile load
   - Uses existing OfflineEarnings module

### Files Changed
- `wally.toml` - Added ProfileService dependency
- `wally.lock` - Updated with ProfileService
- `Packages/ProfileService.lua` - Generated by Wally
- `src/server/ProfileManager.lua` - NEW: ProfileService wrapper module

### Testing
- Build passes with `rojo build`
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- ID #2 should migrate the data schema to work with ProfileManager
- ID #3 should replace all DataPersistence usage with ProfileManager
- ProfileManager uses the same PlayerData schema as DataPersistence
- ProfileService auto-saves on profile:Release() so no manual save needed
- The module is not yet integrated into Main.server.lua (that's part of ID #3)


---

## 2026-01-19 - Migrate Data Schema to ProfileService (ID #2)

### Summary
Added data migration logic to ProfileManager to seamlessly migrate player data from the legacy DataPersistence DataStore to ProfileService.

### Features Implemented
1. **Legacy Data Migration**
   - Added `migrateFromLegacyDataStore()` function to check for existing player data
   - Migration occurs automatically when a new profile is created
   - Validates legacy data before migration using `PlayerData.validate()`
   - Copies all fields from legacy data to the new ProfileService profile

2. **Migration Flow**
   - When a player joins with a new ProfileService profile (totalPlayTime == 0)
   - System checks the old DataStore (`ChickenCoopTycoon_PlayerData_v1`) for existing data
   - If found and valid, data is migrated to the new ProfileService profile
   - Offline earnings are then calculated on the migrated data
   - Player continues with their existing progress

3. **Improved Logging**
   - Profile load now reports migration status: "new", "migrated", or "existing"
   - Success/failure messages distinguish between new players, migrated players, and returning players

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ Player data schema works with ProfileService (was already using `PlayerData.createDefault()` as template)
- ✅ Existing player data migrates correctly (new `migrateFromLegacyDataStore()` function)
- ✅ Offline earnings calculated on rejoin (was already implemented, now also works for migrated data)

### Files Changed
- `src/server/ProfileManager.lua` - Added DataStoreService import, LEGACY_DATA_STORE_NAME constant, and `migrateFromLegacyDataStore()` function. Enhanced `loadProfile()` to check for and migrate legacy data.

### Testing
- Build passes with `rojo build`
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- ID #3 should replace all DataPersistence usage with ProfileManager and delete the legacy file
- The migration is a one-time operation per player - once migrated, they use ProfileService exclusively
- Legacy data is NOT deleted from the old DataStore (safe rollback possible)
- The migration only triggers for profiles where `totalPlayTime == 0` (appears to be new)


---

## 2026-01-19 - Replace DataPersistence with ProfileManager (ID #3)

### Summary
Completed migration from legacy DataPersistence module to ProfileManager, fully integrating ProfileService for player data persistence with session locking.

### Changes Made
1. **Main.server.lua Updates**
   - Replaced `DataPersistence` import with `ProfileManager`
   - Replaced all `DataPersistence.getData(userId)` calls with `ProfileManager.getData(userId)`
   - Replaced all `DataPersistence.get(player)` calls (which were bugs) with `ProfileManager.getData(player.UserId)`
   - Replaced `DataPersistence.save(player)` calls with `ProfileManager.updateData(userId, data)` since ProfileService auto-saves
   - Replaced `DataPersistence.start()` with `ProfileManager.start()`
   - Replaced `DataPersistence.getGlobalChickenCounts()` with `ProfileManager.getGlobalChickenCounts()`
   - Updated initialization logging from "DataPersistence" to "ProfileManager"

2. **AdminCommands.lua Updates**
   - Renamed internal `DataPersistence` variable to `ProfileManager`
   - Updated `init()` function parameter name from `dataPersistence` to `profileManager`
   - Updated `resetData()` function to use ProfileManager (removed explicit save call since ProfileService auto-saves)
   - Updated `giveMoney()` function to use ProfileManager

3. **Deleted Files**
   - Removed `src/server/DataPersistence.lua` (legacy module no longer needed)

4. **Created Tests**
   - Created `src/server/ProfileManager.spec.lua` with TestEZ tests for:
     - `init()` - initialization
     - `getData()` - data retrieval
     - `hasProfile()` - profile check
     - `getLoadedProfileCount()` - count tracking
     - `getGlobalChickenCounts()` - aggregation
     - `updateData()` - data updates
     - `releaseProfile()` - profile release

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ No references to DataPersistence remain (only in ProfileManager for legacy migration)
- ✅ All data operations use ProfileManager
- ✅ DataPersistence.lua is deleted
- ✅ Format check passes with stylua
- ✅ Build passes with rojo

### Notes for Next Developer
- ProfileService auto-saves when profiles are released, so explicit save calls are not needed
- Call `ProfileManager.updateData(userId, data)` after modifying player data to sync to the profile
- The legacy DataStore data migration happens automatically for existing players
- ID #4 (Install Knit) is the next logical step to continue the architecture refactor

---

## 2026-01-19 - Install Knit and Create Server Bootstrap (ID #4)

2. **Services Directory Structure**
   - Created `src/server/Services/` directory for Knit services
   - Added `.gitkeep` to preserve empty directory in git

3. **KnitServer Bootstrap Module** (`src/server/KnitServer.lua`)
   - `loadServices()` - Automatically loads all service modules from Services directory
   - `start()` - Initializes and starts Knit server
   - `isStarted()` - Returns whether Knit has been started
   - `getKnit()` - Returns Knit module for service creation
   - Excludes `.spec` files from service loading

- `src/server/Services/.gitkeep` - NEW: Empty placeholder for services directory
- `src/server/KnitServer.lua` - NEW: Server-side Knit bootstrap module

### Testing
- Build passes with `rojo build`
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- KnitServer is ready but NOT yet integrated into Main.server.lua (will happen in ID #14)
- Create services in `src/server/Services/` using `Knit.CreateService()` pattern
- Services should NOT end with `.spec` (those are test files)
- Next step: ID #5 "Create PlayerDataService" to wrap ProfileManager with Knit
- The `default.project.json` already includes Packages path, no update needed

---

## 2026-01-19 - Create PlayerDataService (ID #5)

### Summary
Created the PlayerDataService Knit service that wraps ProfileManager and exposes player data to clients via Knit's service-based architecture.

### Features Implemented
1. **PlayerDataService Module** (`src/server/Services/PlayerDataService.lua`)
   - Knit service wrapping ProfileManager
   - Client-exposed methods: `GetData`, `GetMoney`, `GetInventory`, `GetPlacedChickens`, `GetLevelInfo`
   - Client signals: `DataChanged`, `MoneyChanged`, `InventoryChanged`, `LevelChanged`
   - Server-only methods: `GetData`, `UpdateData`, `HasProfile`, `SetMoney`, `AddMoney`, `AddXP`, `GetGlobalChickenCounts`, `GetLoadedProfileCount`
   - Server signals: `DataUpdated`, `PlayerLoaded`, `PlayerUnloading`

2. **Automatic Client Notification**
   - When `UpdateData()` is called, client receives `DataChanged` signal
   - Specific change signals fire for money, inventory, and level changes
   - Initial data sent to client on profile load

3. **Server-Side Integration**
   - GoodSignal events for other services to listen to data changes
   - `PlayerLoaded` fires when profile is loaded with `isNewPlayer` flag
   - `PlayerUnloading` fires before profile release

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ Service registers with Knit (via `Knit.CreateService`)
- ✅ Client can request player data via Knit (`GetData`, `GetMoney`, etc.)
- ✅ Data changes trigger signals (`DataChanged`, `MoneyChanged`, etc.)

### Files Changed
- `src/server/Services/PlayerDataService.lua` - NEW: Knit service for player data
- `src/server/Services/PlayerDataService.spec.lua` - NEW: Tests for PlayerDataService

### Testing
- Format check passes with `stylua`
- Build passes with `rojo build`

### Notes for Next Developer
- KnitServer auto-loads services from `src/server/Services/` that don't end in `.spec`
- PlayerDataService is not yet integrated into Main.server.lua (that's ID #14)
- Other services should use `PlayerDataService:GetData(userId)` instead of ProfileManager directly
- Call `PlayerDataService:UpdateData(userId, data)` to save changes and notify clients
- Use `PlayerDataService.DataUpdated:Connect(fn)` to listen for data changes server-side
- ID #6 (ChickenService) is the next logical step to continue the Knit migration

---

## 2026-01-19 - Create ChickenService (ID #6)

### Summary
Created the ChickenService Knit service that wraps all chicken-related server logic, migrating functionality from Main.server.lua into a clean service-based architecture.

### Features Implemented
1. **ChickenService Module** (`src/server/Services/ChickenService.lua`)
   - Knit service wrapping ChickenPlacement, MoneyCollection, and Store modules
   - Client-exposed methods: `PlaceChicken`, `PickupChicken`, `MoveChicken`, `SellChicken`, `CollectMoney`
   - Client signals: `ChickenPlaced`, `ChickenPickedUp`, `ChickenMoved`, `ChickenSold`, `MoneyCollected`
   - Server-only methods: `GetPlayerState`, `GetHealthRegistry`, `GetAIState`, `RegisterChicken`, `UnregisterChicken`, `InitializeAIState`
   - Server signals: `ChickenAdded`, `ChickenRemoved`, `MoneyGenerated`

2. **Per-Player State Management**
   - Tracks `healthRegistry` (ChickenHealth) per player
   - Tracks `aiState` (ChickenAI) per player for free-roaming behavior
   - Auto-initializes on PlayerAdded, cleans up on PlayerRemoving

3. **Integration with PlayerDataService**
   - Uses `PlayerDataService:GetData()` to retrieve player data
   - Uses `PlayerDataService:UpdateData()` to persist changes and notify clients
   - Respects the existing data flow pattern

4. **Event Broadcasting**
   - All placement/pickup/move operations fire to all clients for visual sync
   - Sell and money collection fire only to the owning player
   - Server signals allow other services to react to chicken changes

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ All chicken operations work through ChickenService
- ✅ Client can interact with chickens via Knit (PlaceChicken, PickupChicken, etc.)
- ✅ Tests created (ChickenService.spec.lua)

### Files Changed
- `src/server/Services/ChickenService.lua` - NEW: Knit service for chicken operations
- `src/server/Services/ChickenService.spec.lua` - NEW: Tests for ChickenService

### Testing
- Format check passes with `stylua`
- Build passes with `rojo build`

### Notes for Next Developer
- ChickenService is ready but NOT integrated into Main.server.lua yet (that's ID #14)
- The legacy RemoteFunction handlers in Main.server.lua still work in parallel
- Other services should use `ChickenService:GetHealthRegistry(userId)` to damage chickens
- Use `ChickenService:RegisterChicken(userId, chicken)` when loading saved chickens
- ID #7 (EggService) is the next logical step to continue the Knit migration
- Once all services are migrated (ID #14), the RemoteSetup handlers in Main.server.lua will be removed
