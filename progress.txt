## 2026-01-16 - Fix Predator Targeting Inconsistency (ID #6)

### Summary
Fixed a bug where predators would visually target one chicken but actually capture a different chicken during attacks.

### Problem
The `PredatorAttack.executeAttack` function was using `selectChickensForAttack` which randomly selected chickens to capture, completely ignoring the `targetChickenId` that was set by the predator AI for visual targeting. This caused a disconnect between what the player saw (predator approaching chicken A) and what actually happened (chicken B gets captured).

### Solution
Modified `selectChickensForAttack` in `src/shared/PredatorAttack.lua` to:
1. Accept an optional `targetChickenId` parameter
2. Prioritize the targeted chicken when selecting chickens for attack (if it exists and is not protected)
3. Fill remaining attack slots with random chickens as before

Also updated `executeAttack` to pass the predator's `targetChickenId` from the spawn state to the selection function.

### Files Changed
- `src/shared/PredatorAttack.lua` - Modified `selectChickensForAttack` and `executeAttack` functions
- `src/shared/IntegrationTests.lua` - Added import for PredatorAttack, added test for targeted chicken priority

### Testing
- Added integration test `"PredatorAttack: executeAttack prioritizes targeted chicken"`
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- The predator targeting now correctly prioritizes the chicken it's visually approaching
- If the targeted chicken is protected (newly placed within 15 seconds), a random chicken will be selected instead
- The `PredatorSpawning.updateTargetChicken` function is used by the server to set which chicken a predator is targeting

## 2026-01-16 - Implement Player Leveling System (ID #2)

### Summary
Added a complete player leveling system with XP requirements, level-based difficulty scaling for predators, and HUD display for level/XP progress.

### Features Implemented
1. **LevelConfig Module** (`src/shared/LevelConfig.lua`)
   - XP requirements per level (base 100 XP, scaling 15% per level)
   - Max level: 100
   - Functions: `getLevelFromXP`, `getXPForLevel`, `getLevelProgress`, `getXPToNextLevel`
   - Max predators scale with level (1 at level 1, up to 8 at high levels)
   - Threat level unlocks: Minor(1), Moderate(5), Dangerous(15), Severe(30), Deadly(50), Catastrophic(75)

2. **PlayerData Updates** (`src/shared/PlayerData.lua`)
   - Added `level` and `xp` fields to `PlayerDataSchema`
   - New functions: `getLevel`, `getXP`, `addXP`, `setLevelAndXP`
   - `addXP` returns new level when player levels up

3. **PredatorSpawning Updates** (`src/shared/PredatorSpawning.lua`)
   - `SpawnState` now includes `playerLevel`
   - `createSpawnState(playerLevel)` accepts player level
   - `getMaxActivePredators` now uses `LevelConfig.getMaxPredatorsForLevel`
   - `selectPredatorForWave` respects threat level unlocks based on player level
   - `setPlayerLevel` function for updating level on spawn state

4. **MainHUD Level Display** (`src/client/MainHUD.lua`)
   - Level badge in top-left corner showing "Level X"
   - XP progress bar below level text
   - `setLevelAndXP(level, xp, progress)` function
   - `showLevelUp(newLevel, unlocks)` celebration notification
   - `showXPGain(amount)` floating XP text

5. **Remote Events** (`src/server/RemoteSetup.lua`)
   - Added `XPGained` and `LevelUp` events

### Files Changed
- `src/shared/LevelConfig.lua` - NEW: Level configuration and XP calculations
- `src/shared/PlayerData.lua` - Added level/xp fields and helper functions
- `src/shared/PredatorSpawning.lua` - Level-based predator scaling
- `src/client/MainHUD.lua` - Level/XP HUD display and level-up effects
- `src/server/RemoteSetup.lua` - Added XPGained and LevelUp events
- `src/shared/IntegrationTests.lua` - Added 12 new tests for leveling system

### Testing
- Added integration tests for LevelConfig functions
- Added tests for PlayerData XP/level functions
- Added tests for PredatorSpawning level integration
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- XP reward system (ID #7) should use `PlayerData.addXP()` to award XP for actions
- When `addXP` returns a number (new level), fire the `LevelUp` remote to show celebration
- Call `PredatorSpawning.setPlayerLevel(state, level)` when player levels up to update spawning
- The client should call `MainHUD.setLevelAndXP()` when receiving `PlayerDataChanged`
- Threat level unlocks mean players won't face Bears until level 75

   - Night cycle completion tracking for XP awards

4. **Client Integration** (`src/client/Main.client.lua`)
   - Added `XPGained` event handler to show XP gain notifications
   - Added `LevelUp` event handler to show level-up celebrations

5. **Sound Effects** (`src/client/SoundEffects.lua`)

### XP Reward Values
| Action | Base XP | Multiplier |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Kill Predator | 25 | Threat level (1-32x) |
| Hatch Chicken | 10 | Rarity (1-32x) |

## 2026-01-16 - Implement In-Area Chicken Selling (ID #5)

### Summary
Enabled the in-area chicken selling feature that allows players to sell chickens directly by walking up to them and pressing F, with a confirmation dialog showing the sell price.

### Features Enabled
1. **Proximity Sell Prompts**
   - "[E] Pick Up" prompt shows on the left side of screen when near a chicken
   - "[F] Sell (price)" prompt shows on the right side when near a chicken
   - Prompts are positioned side-by-side to avoid overlap

2. **Server-Side Sale Integration**
   - Added `ChickenSelling.setPerformServerSale()` callback for server communication
   - Wired up to invoke `SellChicken` RemoteFunction on the server
   - Plays money collect sound on successful sale
   - Plays error sound on failed sale

3. **Mobile Touch Support**
   - Added `MobileTouchControls` import and initialization
   - Wired up all button actions: pickup, place, cancel, sell, confirm
   - Shows chicken context (pickup + sell) when near a chicken
   - Shows place context (place + cancel) when holding a chicken
   - Shows sell confirmation context when confirming a sale

4. **Store Module Enhancement**
   - Added `sellPrice` field to `Store.sellChicken()` return value
   - Returns total value including accumulated money for proper UI feedback

### Files Changed
- `src/client/ChickenSelling.lua` - Fixed prompt position, added `setPerformServerSale` callback, refactored `confirmSell` to use server callback
- `src/client/ChickenPickup.lua` - Fixed prompt position to offset left
- `src/client/Main.client.lua` - Added MobileTouchControls import, wired up server sale callback, enabled sell prompts, initialized mobile touch controls
- `src/shared/Store.lua` - Added `sellPrice` to sell transaction return value

### Testing
- Build check passes with `rojo build`
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- The ChickenSelling module now properly communicates with the server via the `SellChicken` RemoteFunction
- When a chicken is sold, the server fires `ChickenSold` event and syncs player data automatically
- Mobile players see contextual touch buttons on the right side of the screen
- The "[E] Pick Up" and "[F] Sell" prompts appear side-by-side when near a chicken
- Sell confirmation dialog shows chicken name, rarity, and total value (base + accumulated money)

## 2026-01-16 - Lower Money Counter Position (ID #1)

### Summary
Lowered the money counter position in the bottom-left HUD by reducing excess frame height.

### Problem
The money counter frame was 70 pixels tall but only contained a 36-pixel money label (the money icon and money-per-second label were previously removed for a cleaner UI). This left 34 pixels of unused vertical space, making the counter appear higher than necessary on screen.

### Solution
Reduced the `DEFAULT_CONFIG.size` height from 70 to 44 pixels in `src/client/MainHUD.lua`. The new height properly fits the money label with minimal padding (36px label + 4px top padding + 4px space at bottom).

### Files Changed
- `src/client/MainHUD.lua` - Reduced money frame height from 70 to 44 pixels

### Testing
- Build passes with `rojo build`
- Format check passes with `stylua`

### Notes for Next Developer
- The money counter is now positioned 26 pixels lower on screen
- The frame uses `anchorPoint = Vector2.new(0, 1)` for bottom-left anchoring
- The position offset of -10 from the bottom edge is preserved
